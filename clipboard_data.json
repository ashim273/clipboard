    "content": "Q: What do you copy most often?\nA: It’s kind of random—sometimes images, sometimes text. I also copy links from emails or Common App essays when I move between platforms.\n\nQ: Would you actually use something like ClipBoard?\nA: Depends. If it ran in the background and didn’t get in the way, maybe. I’d love if it remembered links and snippets, especially during college app crunch.\n\nQ: How concerned would you be about private stuff being saved?\nA: Yeah that could be a dealbreaker. Sometimes I copy pieces of personal statements or private info from Naviance—so I’d need a clear “delete now” button or filters.\n\nQ: What’s your biggest frustration with copy-paste right now?\nA: Losing copied content when switching between apps. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve copied an essay paragraph, pasted over it by accident, and lost it.\n\nQ: Feature request?\nA: Maybe syncing between devices? Like if I copied something on my laptop, could I access it later on my phone?",

It’s a lot of copy-paste chaos.\n\nQ: Would it help to have a searchable history of what you copied?\nA: 100%. Sometimes I copy a quote and then overwrite it accidentally. If ClipBoard helps me tag things or auto-organize quotes, that would be amazing.\n\nQ: How would you feel about it saving everything you copy, even by accident?\nA: I’d be a little nervous if it kept private notes or messages. I’d want to know how to delete specific items—or maybe exclude certain apps like Notes or Messenger.\n\nQ: Would you care about categories like ‘quotes’ vs. ‘plain text’?\nA: Definitely. If it could auto-detect quotes or even just save the source URL with it, that would be golden for research papers.\n\nQ: Anything you’d change?\nA: A visual interface would help—like a timeline view of what I copied. Maybe even a favorite/star feature?",

I’ll often copy something, get distracted, and then lose it.\n\nQ: Would a clipboard history app like ClipBoard be useful to you?\nA: Yeah, definitely. Especially if it can separate code from regular text or links—I spend too much time digging through old files or notes just to find a line I copied earlier.\n\nQ: How would you imagine using it in a school setting?\nA: During coding assignments or comps prep. Also useful when writing research papers—copying citations or quotes I don’t want to lose.\n\nQ: How worried would you be about it storing sensitive information, like passwords or private messages?\nA: Pretty worried. I sometimes copy login tokens or test keys by accident. I’d want the option to blacklist certain apps or clear recent entries quickly.\n\nQ: Anything you’d want improved or added?\nA: A “private mode” would be great—something that stops recording clipboard activity when toggled.",
